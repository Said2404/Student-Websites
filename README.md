# 🌐 Student Websites

Welcome to the **Student Websites** project! This project includes two versions of a website: one with a design created by me and my team, and another with a design requested by the client. The project was developed as part of a university assignment.

## 🌟 Project Goal
The goal of this project was to gain experience working in a team to solve real-world problems. Our objective was to create a website for alumni of the IT department at the IUT of Metz and manage the work collaboratively.
